To use this script: Edit the values in the CONFIGURATION SECTION, and then upload it to a web hosting provider of your choice.
You can then point any RSS reader app at this file's URL and it should work.

I used Zapier, which allowed me to configure an email trigger in
about five minutes on a free account.
 
Enjoying the script? Wanna say thanks?

My social media accounts and stuff are there, too, if you're into that sort of thing.
